Project Steps:
Data Cleaning with Power Query:

Cleaned the raw dataset using Power Query to ensure data consistency and correct formatting.
Adjusted column data types to match the type of data they hold (e.g., dates, numbers).
KPI Development and Chart Creation:

Created key performance indicators (KPIs) using Pivot Tables to track important metrics such as average response times, the number of calls handled, and customer satisfaction levels.
Developed various charts (bar charts, line charts, etc.) to visually represent these KPIs.
Dashboard Design:

Designed and styled the dashboard to ensure clarity and usability, using appropriate color schemes and layout principles.
Added slicers to make the dashboard dynamic, allowing users to filter data based on different dimensions like date, call center region, or agent performance.
Key Features:
Interactive Dashboard: Users can explore different metrics through slicers and filters.
Data Cleaning: Power Query was used to handle missing data and incorrect formatting.
KPI Tracking: Key call center metrics are displayed for easy analysis.
Charts: Multiple types of visualizations provide insights into call center performance.
Tools Used:
Excel
Power Query
Pivot Tables
Conclusion:
This project showcases the use of Excel to develop an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that can be used by call center managers to track performance metrics and make data-driven decisions.
